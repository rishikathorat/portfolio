            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <p>Attending the SAP Partner Summit was one of the most memorable experiences for me. During this, I was able to hear from industry experts 
            from 14 of SAP's Fortune 500 customers and had the opportunity of networking with executives from companies like Infosys and Microsoft. The
            main reason this field trip stands out to me is because I was able to hear from the top executives of SAP and their journey to where they
            are now. This Q+A session was inspiring, as it shows students like me that they can reach where they want to be with perseverance.</p>
            <p>Getting to hear Laura Keigelmeyer as a guest speaker was an enjoyable experience. It was inspiring to hear about how her family immigrated
            to the U.S and the challenges she overcame (i.e being discouraged from attending grad. school). Even with these, she was able to succeed
            and found work at Lawrence Livermore National Labarotory. It was interesting to hear about how she helped found the NIF automated optics program 
            and the details of her work using the laser facility and showed me a new field I might like to explore in the future.</p>
