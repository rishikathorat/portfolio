            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <p>SAP Partner Summit:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Attending the SAP Partner Summit was one of the most memorable experiences for me. During this, I was able to hear from industry experts 
            from 14 of SAP's Fortune 500 customers and had the opportunity of networking with executives from companies like Infosys and Microsoft. The
            main reason this field trip stands out to me is because I was able to hear from the top executives of SAP and their journey to where they
            are now. This Q+A session was inspiring, as it shows students like me that they can reach where they want to be with perseverance.</p>
            <p>SJSU and SCU Visit</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Another field trip I had the opportunity of going on was visiting the San Jose State and Santa Clara univiersities. This field trip
            allowed me to get a first-hand experience of the environment there and the great engineering programs. It was interesting to hear from the students on the coursework they were taking and opportunities offered through the programs. These were unfortunately my only college visits, due to COVID-19, and were really helpful when applying to and considering colleges to attend!</p>
            <p>SheLeads Conference:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding"> In February 2021, I got the chance to attend the SheLeads Conference and meet many influential women in diverse engineering fields. The Round Robin session was the most memorable part of this field trip to me, as we were able to network with female professionals from various backgrounds and hear their unique journies!</p>  
            <p>Oracle Job Shadow:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">In October 2020, I had the opportunity of attending the virtual Oracle Job Shadow in which I was able to be a part of multiple rotations and hear from
                employees from diverse software-engineering based fields! I found this similar to my experience at the SheLeads conference and with the mentorship program. It was encouraging to hear from them how different their paths could be to work there!</p>
            <p>She Leads STEM Summit:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">One of the virtual field trips I had the opportunity of attending was the She Leads STEM Summit. The workshops that stood out to me were the Microsoft Linkedin
                workshop and the Bank of America Financial Literacy workshop. These were really relevant to me as I'm starting to build my financial knowledge and my Linkedin 
                profile in preparation for my first year of college!</p>
            <p>Chevron Career Day:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Another virtual field trip I attended was Chevron Career Day! It was really interesting to hear from the guest speakers - a personally notable speaker worked
                in finance management & procurement, which was really cool! As a student interested in computer science and business/communication-related fields, it was awesome to hear about how Chevron employees integrated these types of fields into their engineering-based work!
            <p>Guest Speaker - Laura Keigelmeyer:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Getting to hear Laura Keigelmeyer as a guest speaker was an enjoyable experience. It was inspiring to hear about how her family immigrated
            to the U.S and the challenges she overcame (i.e being discouraged from attending grad. school). Even with these, she was able to succeed
            and found work at Lawrence Livermore National Labarotory. It was interesting to hear about how she helped found the NIF automated optics program 
            and the details of her work using the laser facility and showed me a new field I might like to explore in the future.</p>
            <p>Guest Speakers - Kana Mishra and Aileen Inguiez:</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Two guest speakers that were influential to me this year were Kana Mishra and Aileen Inguiez. Kana Mishra, a DHS alumni,
               studies data science at UC Berkeley. It was interesting to hear about how she meshed her passions for data science and computer science and her 
               work with natural language processing and data cleaning. Aileen Inguiez had a similar interest in data science and talked about her journey from
               college to working with Chevron. Aileen also talked about the importance of data science as the future progresses, which I
               thought was interesting!</p>
            <p>Junior Mentorship Program</p>
            <p class="leftpadding">Through the Engineering Academy, I had the amazing opportunity of being able to participate in the Mentor Program. As a part of this program, I've
            been able to meet multiple engineers in diverse fields and gotten to learn about different pathways that I wouldnt've considered before. Moreover, this 
            program introduced me to the many different aspects of college and helped me better prepare!</p>
