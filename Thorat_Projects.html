                <p><strong>Project</strong>: Scratch Maze Game</p>

                <p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) </p>
                <p>In this project, the objective was to design a game using the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">MIT Scratch program</a> My team composed of me, Donna P. and Jacob S. We designed a maze game, which included abundant user interaction, multiple levels and a clear 
                    objective to win. We created many levels in our maze game, so the user was challenged and also having a fun time playing our
                    game. In the duration of making this project, my team and I also sustained a <a class="ecolution" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uBL4KnLhsQFfVqmjcn47hDJr96QWbKWsfk6rIDQxyCc/edit?usp=sharing">Project Notebook</a>, in which we documented brainstorming ideas, a flowchart showing our thought process and a daily log. These are the <a class="ecolution" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="_blank">requirements</a> for this project.

                <p>In this self-initiated project, the goal was to explore the languages of HTML/CSS more and practice
                my skills learnt in CSE. I asked a local preschoolâ€™s owner, <a class="ecolutiona"href="www.blossompreschool.net">Blossom Preschool</a>, if I could create a website for the business. I enjoyed this process because I encountered new things such as hosting websites through different sites. This experience helped me strengthen my web-development skills.

                <p>In this project, the objective was to create a composite image for our specific client, a family. We chose to add borders and incorporated geometric shapes into the image. Per the client's requests, we offered a range of options.

                <p>In this project, the objective was to create a car out of VEX Robotic parts and test to see which power source works better, hydrogen or solar, for our client Tesla Motors.

My main responsibility throughout this project, was preparing the materials to be made into the insulation (i.e shredding the jeans, cutting the cork) and doing material research, shown as "Material Description' on the documentation. Based off of our testing summary, we recommended our insulation.
