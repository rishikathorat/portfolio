                <h2>An aspiring engineer and business woman.</h2>
                <p> Hi! My name is Rishika. I am a student at Dublin High School and aspire to pursue a career in computer science and business management. 
                Throughout my education, I have realized that I have a strong interest in math, computers and science. 
                I also like to create business plans, marketing presentations and present my ideas to the audience. 
                I love to work in teams and collaborate with others to develop ideas. I believe that computer programming is simply 
                creating solutions for real world problems, and this motivates me. Creating something that could be used by and help 
                others gives me joy. I plan to take many STEM related courses during my high school career and participate in the Engineering and Design 
                Academy. I also plan to participate in DECA to enhance my business and presentation skills </p>
                <p> "Whatever you do, you do it till the end and do it with full dedication," has been my motto since childhood. 
                Ever since I was 5, I have persistently followed my passion for Hindustani (Indian) Classical music and dance form of Bharatanatyam. 
                This taught me the importance of not quitting and striving for excellence. In 2016, my dance team created a nonprofit group, where we 
                raised a little over $20,000 for cancer research benefiting Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. We are also working on hosting 
                another event this year with the goal of matching or surpassing our previous fundraising. </p>
                <p> In January 2017, me and my teammates designed a business plan for an app, <a class="ecolution" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nT6oWResWFgQSeFCVE7NVy1s5HjGN-asIbi-HC8PLE0/edit?usp=sharing">
                Ecolution</a>, that would raise awareness and help people make environmentally-responsible decisions. We won 1st place in the Silicon 
                Valley Pitch Fest. We are now in the process of building the app and the website and hope to raise awareness about the declining health 
                of the environment. </p>
