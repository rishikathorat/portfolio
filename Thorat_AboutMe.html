                <h2>An aspiring computer scientist and business woman.</h2>
                <p> Hi! My name is Rishika Thorat. I am a student at Dublin High School and aspire to pursue a career in computer science and business management. 
                Throughout my education, I have realized that I have a strong interest in math, computers and science. 
                I also enjoy creating business plans, marketing presentations and presenting my ideas to an audience. 
                I love to work in teams and collaborate with others to develop ideas. I believe that computer programming is simply 
                creating solutions for real world problems, and this motivates me. Creating something that could be used by and help 
                others gives me joy. I plan to take many STEM related courses during my high school career as I am enrolled into the Dublin Engineering and
                Design Academy. </p>
                <p> "Whatever you do, you do it till the end and do it with full dedication," has been my motto since childhood. 
                Ever since I was 5, I have persistently followed my passion for Hindustani (Indian) Classical music and dance form of Bharatanatyam. 
                This taught me the importance of not quitting and striving for excellence. In 2016, my dance team created a nonprofit group (Prathibha
                Arts Foundation, where we raised a little over $20,000 for cancer research benefiting Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Now, as the vice president,
                the other officers and I are also working on hosting another event this year with the goal of matching or surpassing our previous fundraising. </p>
                <p> This summer, I was awarded a scholarship to attend the Kode with Klossy mobile development camp, run by Karlie Kloss. In 2 weeks, the other female
                coders and I were able to proficiently learn Swift and UI design on Xcode! To further our learning, another scholarship recipient and I built an app, Ascend, 
                to address the ongoing immigration and deportation issue and help provide information and comfort to those in risk. We completed the business plan and the coding 
                of the app and are competing in the Congressional App Challenge this fall!</p>
